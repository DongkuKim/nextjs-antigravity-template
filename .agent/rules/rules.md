# User Rules

Define custom rules for the agent here.

## Package Management
## Package Management
- **ALWAYS** use `npm` for managing dependencies. Never use `yarn` or `pnpm` unless explicitly requested.

## Architecture
- Enforce clean separation business logic and others.

## Testing
- Require unit tests for all function.


## GitHub & Collaboration
- **Assignments**: Always assign the **current user** (self) to any Issue or Pull Request you create. Verify the current user with `get_me` if unsure.

## General Behavior
- **ALWAYS** adhere to the [clean-code skill](.agent/skills/clean-code/SKILL.md) for all coding tasks. Be concise, direct, and avoid over-engineering.
